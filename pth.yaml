Description: |
    Pth is a very portable POSIX/ANSI-C based library for Unix platforms
    which provides non-preemptive priority-based scheduling for multiple
    threads of execution ("multithreading") inside server applications.
    All threads run in the same address space of the server application,
    but each thread has it's own individual program-counter, run-time
    stack, signal mask and errno variable.

Builder: no-make
